RSCC is an open source, cross-platform command & control framework that allows you to control your agents (targets) via SSH.

## Features

Since RSCC is based on SSH, it has the following features:

- Cross-platform agents
- Fully interactive shell
- File transfer via SCP or SFTP
- Local / Remote  port forwarding
- Chain SOCKS5 proxy via SSH -D

**Also you can extend agent with your own SSH subsystems!**

As an example, there is a [port scanner subsystem](./pkg/agent/internal/sshd/subsystems/pscan.go) that allows you to scan the target host for open ports from the agent.
